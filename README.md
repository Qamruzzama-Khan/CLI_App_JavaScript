### Introduction

This project is a simple command-line calculator built using Node.js. It utilizes the `readline` module to interact with users via the terminal. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) by providing two operands and an operator.

### Description

1. **Purpose**: 
   - The primary goal of this project is to create a basic CLI calculator that prompts the user for two numbers and an arithmetic operator, then calculates and displays the result.

2. **Functionality**:
   - **Input Handling**: 
     - The program asks the user to enter the first operand, then the operator, and finally the second operand.
     - Each input is collected using the `readline` module, which facilitates interaction with the terminal.
   - **Calculation**:
     - Based on the operator provided (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), the program performs the appropriate arithmetic operation.
     - Special handling is included for division to avoid division by zero, and for invalid operators.
   - **Output**:
     - After performing the calculation, the result is displayed in the terminal.
     - The program provides feedback for invalid inputs or division by zero.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The program includes basic error handling to manage invalid operators and division by zero, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

4. **Usage**:
   - To run the program, users simply execute the script in a Node.js environment. The program will prompt them for the required inputs and display the result directly in the terminal.

### Key Features

- **Interactive CLI**: Uses `readline` to handle user input and output in a terminal environment.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Error Handling**: Includes checks for division by zero and invalid operators to provide informative error messages.

This project demonstrates fundamental principles of command-line programming in Node.js and provides a useful tool for performing basic arithmetic calculations directly from the terminal.
